  abstract  = "Human intent inference is a key factor in shared autonomy. The
               control of robotic prosthetic hands with inherent
               human-in-the-loop operations is not an exception.
               State-of-the-art methods use electromyography (EMG) signals to
               infer grasp types. But this approach is limited by important
               robustness issues which renders its use limited outside labs. In
               this paper, we use a particle filtering based technique to infer
               user intent based on the trajectories of the user's hand. Our
               methodology generates an estimation of the expected
               time-to-arrive, i.e. time left until reaching to the object,
               which is an essential variable in successful grasping of
               objects. The approach is integrated using a probabilistic
               framework which can incorporate information from all available
               sources. We have tested our algorithm with 80 reaching
               trajectories collected from 5 individuals reaching to one of
               four objects at a time. The results demonstrate a classification
               accuracy of 87.5\% for the entire reaching period.",
