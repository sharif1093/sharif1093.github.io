  abstract  = "Robot prosthetic hands intend to replicate one's lost abilities
               through intuitive control. So far, control methods that rely
               heavily on the human input such as Electromyographic (EMG) and
               Electroneurographic (ENG) signals have been predominantly
               studied. However, these methods face issues such as lack of
               robustness resulting in abandonment of this technology by the
               users. There is a need for a paradigm shift in the robot
               prosthetic hand control methods. With this regard, we propose an
               end-to-end learning of control policy for a robot prosthetic
               hand through reinforcement learning. Imitation learning has been
               fostered to help with the sparse reward setting in the
               hard-to-explore state-space of the problem. The results in
               simulation show the feasibility of successfully learning an
               endto-end policy for grasping objects by robot prosthetic hands,
               potentially increasing robustness for grasp control of future
               robot prosthetic hands.",
