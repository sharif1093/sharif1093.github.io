  abstract  = "In this paper we consider the synthesis of sparse stabilizing
               static state feedback controllers subject to state and control
               constraints. The presence of information constraints renders
               this problem generically NP-hard. However, as we show in the
               paper, a convergent sequence of tractable convex relaxations
               with optimality certificates can be obtained by transforming the
               problem into a polynomial optimization form. The effectiveness
               of the proposed technique is illustrated with a numerical
               example.",
